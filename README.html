When working with sinusoidal signals like the ones you can find in our current electricity distribution system, it is much easier to work with complex numbers like <span class="blue">a+bj</span> where, j^2 = -1. This is called the <span class="blue">rectangular</span> form of the complex number. In this way, numbers <span class="blue">a</span> and <span class="blue">b</span> mean the coordinates of the signal on the complex plane - the Real and Imaginary axis, respectively. In some cases it is advantageous to convert this form to the so called <span class="blue">polar</span> form where the important things are <span class="blue">magnitude</span> (size of the vector in the complex plane) and <span class="blue">phase</span> angle (the angle the vector holds with the Real axis). The representation of the signal in the polar form is called a phase vector or a <span class="blue">phasor</span>.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to create a class representing the phasor. It must be possible to instantiate this class using either rectangular or polar coordinates and convert between the two. Then you will have to implement the basic arithmetics of phasors - <span class="blue">addition</span>, <span class="blue">subtraction</span>, <span class="blue">multiplication</span> and <span class="blue">division</span>. This class could then be applied for example to an automatic solver of AC circuits.
</p>

<p>
So how to convert. The original AC signal has a general form <span class="blue">A*cos(wt + theta)</span> where A is the amplitude (peak), w is angular frequency in radians per second, t stands for time (the signal varies in time) and theta is the phase angle (how much the signal is shifted to the left or right from the normal cosine).
</p>

<p>
The phasor of such a signal preserves only the information about its amplitude, or magnitude, and phase so it's written as <span class="blue">A&lsaquo;theta</span>. If you want to convert this into the rectangular form, the formula is <span class="blue">a = A*cos(theta)</span> - that is the coordinate on the real axis - and <span class="blue">b = A*sin(theta)</span> - which is the imaginary coordinate.
</p>

<p>
Now if you have the rectangular form and want to convert to the polar, the formulas are <span class="blue">A = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)</span> and <span class="blue">theta = arctan(b/a)</span>. All these mathematical methods are shipped with C++ so you get them for free.
</p>

<p>
One important thing to keep in mind is that the angles that your program accepts and outputs must always be in degrees, contrary to what methods from the <span class="blue">cmath library</span> do. So you'll also have to know how to convert these angles to radians. Basically 360 degress is the same thing as 2pi radians. From that you can derive that to obtain radians from an angle in degrees, you have to <span class="blue">multiply it by pi and then divide by 180</span>. And if you want to go the other way, do the opposite, <span class="blue">multiply the angle in radians by 180 and then divide by pi</span>.
</p>

<p>For more information, better explanations, graphs and all that you could wish to know, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor" class="external">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>
Next you also need to know how to do basic arithmetic operations with the phasors and hopefully the conversions from above will start to make sense here. <span class="blue">Adding and subtracting</span> phasors is easier when you do it in the rectangular form and it works like this:
</p>

<div class="blue center">a1 + b1j + a2 + b2j = (a1 + a2) + (b1 + b2)j</div>
<div class="blue center">a1 + b1j - (a2 + b2j) = (a1 - a2) + (b1 - b2)j</div>

<p>
Multiplying and dividing phasors is on the contrary easier in the polar form and it works like this:
</p>

<div class="blue center">A1&lsaquo;theta1 * A2&lsaquo;theta2 = A1*A2&lsaquo;(theta1 + theta2)</div>
<div class="blue center">A1&lsaquo;theta1 / A2&lsaquo;theta2 = (A1/A2)&lsaquo;(theta1 - theta2)</div>

<p>
See? That's much easier than dividing complex numbers. So that's all that you need to know to complete the challenge. <span class="blue">Good luck!</span>
